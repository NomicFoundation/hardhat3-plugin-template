# My Hardhat 3 plugin

This is an example project that uses your plugin.

## Getting started

To run this project, you need to install the dependencies and build the plugin:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

Then, you can run hardhat with:

```sh
pnpm hardhat my-task
```

## What's inside the project?

This project is similar to what you get when initializing a Hardhat 3 project with `npx hardhat --init`, but without any of the Hardhat toolboxes.

This means that you don't have `ethers,` `viem`, `mocha`, nor the Node.js test runner plugins.

Please install whichever dependency or plugin you need in here. This package won't be published, so you have complete freedom to do whatever you want.
